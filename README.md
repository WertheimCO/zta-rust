Zero trust architecture using RUST.

This code defines a User struct to represent a user with a username and a set of roles, and three functions to authenticate a user, authorize a user's access to a resource, and access a protected resource. The authenticate function performs authentication checks and returns a User object if the user is authenticated. The authorize function performs authorization checks based on the user's roles and the requested resource and returns a boolean indicating whether the user is authorized. The access_protected_resource function calls the authenticate and authorize functions and attempts to access the protected resource if the user is authenticated and authorized.

In this example, the access_protected_resource function implements the zero trust architecture by performing authentication and authorization checks before allowing access to the protected resource. This ensures that all network traffic is verified and authenticated before accessing the protected resource, even if the traffic is originating from within the network.
